## Introduction
This Microsoft Excel project analyzes shopping trends of an imaginary fashion store to provide valuable insights for marketing campaigns. The aim of this project is to answer crucial questions that will help the marketing department effectively channel their efforts and maximize their impact.

## Problem Statement
The marketing department aims to launch a campaign in the second quarter of 2024. However, they require a dashboard to monitor business activity during the waiting period. This will provide insights into where to channel the campaign efforts. The Marketing lead would like to track various metrics over time, including product performance, changes in customers' choice of color, location, and seasonality patterns in relation to orders. Additionally, any other metric(s) deemed necessary should be incorporated into the dashboard.
